# While loop

# While loop is used to execute a block of code multiple times until the condition is true.
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

index = 0
while index < len(fruits): # Here's how you use while loop
  print(fruits[index])
  index += 1 # Don't forget to increment the index variable, otherwise it will be an infinite loop.
