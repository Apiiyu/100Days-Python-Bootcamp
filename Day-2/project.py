# Tip Calculator

"""Instructions
  If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.
  Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
  Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60
  Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª
  
  Hint
  1. Try to find out the data type of the result of the input function.
  2. Google how to convert a string into a float.
  3. Experiment with different ways of rounding.

# Solution
print("Welcome to the tip calculator.")
bill = float(input("What was the total bill? $"))
tip_percentage = float(input("What percentage tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? "))
number_of_people = int(input("How many people to split the bill? "))

tip = bill * (tip_percentage / 100)
bill += tip
bill_per_person = bill / number_of_people

print(f"Each person should pay: ${bill_per_person:.2f}")
